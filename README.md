# FiveM React Boilerplate with TypeScript

This is built upon [fivem-react-boilerplate](https://github.com/2277/fivem-react-boilerplate) but with my personal preferences and working with TypeScript.

# Setup

```
git clone https://github.com/99kr/fivem-ts-react-boilerplate.git resourcename
```

Navigate into `nui`.
```
npm install
```

## Run a local development server
```
npm start
```

## Build it

```

### Happy Developing :)
